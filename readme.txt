== Description ==

Web3 Coin Gate is an innovative cryptocurrency authentication plugin for WordPress. Web3 Coin Gate allows website owners to restrict content to only users who verify they own a specific token in their cryptocurrency wallet. Web3 Coin Gate authenticates the user and checks ownership of their crypto wallet. Use this plugin to create exclusive gated content for your cryptocurrency token.

The Free version of Web3 Coin Gate works only with ERC 721 standard coins. Users must verify ownership using a MetaMask wallet.
For more blockchain and wallet integrations see Web3 Coin Gate Pro!

Web3 Coin Gate allows you to set two separate custom responses. Upon successful verification users will receive a message with the hidden content. If the users cannot verify ownership they will receive a second failed verification message.
